    <h1>About the Gallery</h1>
    <p>This gallery showcases concept art from the Halo video game series which I absolutely adore ever since I was a kid. <div>
        <p>Halo has been a significant part of my life, inspiring me with its rich lore and stunning visuals.</p>
        <p>Please feel free to go to my own website portfolio I have linked in the top right of this navbar as well as a major concept artist, Issac Hannaford's own portfolio
            <div>Please feel free to tell me other concept artists so I can link them as well.</div>
        </p>
    </div>
        Also, this project lets me practice my web development skills for a passion I have. Thanks for checking it all out!</p>
